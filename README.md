# Enchant

Our cutting-edge Kotlin Multiplatform tech stack is powered largely by Enchant, a library we built ourselves to power cross-platform Firebase and ViewModel development.

What it means? Write code once. Deploy to multiple targets. Match native performance. ðŸ˜Ž

### Flare ðŸ”¥
At TeraThought, we use Firebase as a flexible solution for our backend - it gives us a NoSQL database, real-time cloud functions, analytics, and much more!

Flare is our library to work with anything and everything Firebase in Kotlin Multiplatform!

### Magic ðŸŒ€
To organize our app development, we use an MVVM architecture. Between user-interface views and business logic models, ViewModels are the important middlemen that handle and respond to user interaction.

To work with ViewModels super efficiently in Kotlin Multiplatform, we developed Magic.
